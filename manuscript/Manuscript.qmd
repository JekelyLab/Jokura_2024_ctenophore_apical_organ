## Abstract



**text in bold** *italic* [underline]{.underline}

## Introduction

First descriptions of AO: [@aronova1974electron]

The lobate ctenophore *Mnemiopsis*

The lithocytes have a large calcium carbonate concretion and... [@Tamm_2014]
Living lithocytes are transported along the balancer cilia to the tip of the statocyst [@Noda_2014]
The projections of a group of bridge cells located on two sides of the apical organ forms an arch and connects the balancers along the tentacular plane [@Tamm_2002].





The easiest way is to use the command line to add new refs to the .bib file:

```{bash}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

#curl -LH "Accept: application/x-bibtex" https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.91258.1 >> references.bib
```


## Results

### Volume EM reconstruction of the *Mnemiopsis* apical organ

- specimen 
- volume, resolution, fixation, quality
- number of sections
- skeletonisation in Catmaid
- number of cells
- general anatomy, regions, quadrants


```{r, out.width = "100%", fig.cap="**Figure 1. Title fig 1** pic of a larva, boxed region of AO, schematic, catmaid pic with slice, dimensions, quadrants, regions, (A) legend (B) legend. " }
#| echo: false 

knitr::include_graphics("figures/Figure1.png")
```


### Classification of cell types

- ultrastructural criteria (cilia, vesicles etc)
- number of types, cells per type - table


```{r, out.width = "100%", fig.cap="**Figure 2. Title fig 2** Balancer complex: balancer, lithocyte, groove 2 types, bridge - EM pics, (A) legend (B) legend. " }
#| echo: false 

knitr::include_graphics("figures/Figure2.png")
```


"the larval bridge has not yet developed forks at its ends, as seen in adult Mnemiopsis bridges"[@Tamm_2002]

Figure3 - dome, bicil, monocil, no-cil, plumose, dense vesicle cells (rename), gland? cells, oligo/multiciliated cells

Plumose cells [@Hernandez_Nicaise_1984] may be pressure sensors [@Tamm_2014b]

Figure4 - lamellate body complex, LB, intra-multi-ciliated, relationship to balancer

Figure5 - nerve net, different fragments/cells/syntytia, EM, relation to entire organ

Figure 6 -  cilia? renderings of basal bodies, centrioles, length, axoneme structure (table), table about cell types, number of cilia etc.

## Synapses 

"synaptic regions with the characteristic presynaptic triad mor-
phology of ctenophore nerves (i.e., a single layer of
vesicles, smooth ER sac, and closely apposed mito-
chondria [@Horridge_1964; @Hernandez_Nicaise_1973] Hernandez-
Nicaise, 1973)"

Figure 7 - synapses, reconstruction, annotation, numbers, distribution of partners, example EM (figure supplement - lots of EM), mitochondria
(Fig suppl - mitochondrion stats - Sanja)

Gap juntions? Innexins are expressed in the apical organ in specific patches of cells in each quadrant [@Ortiz_2023]


Ctenophore synapses [@Hernandez_Nicaise_1973]

We found no synapses between bridge and balancer, in agreement with Tamm [@Tamm_2002].

Figure 8 - connectome
cell-type based, quadrant based, nerve net syntycia, bridge, quadrants
(Fig suppl - cell-based network)

Tamm&Tamm observed synapses from neurites to bridge cells (2002).
and in Mnemiopsis larvae observed synapses from bridge cells onto other cells

Inserting Figures

You can add your figures into the rendered document. We saved the figures into /manuscript/figures or /manuscript/figure_supplements and can insert them from there. We use knitr::include_graphics for this. The title and legend can also be edited, as will as the width of the output figure.

## Equations

Equations can also be inserted, Insert -\> Display Math:

$$
\bar{X} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}}{n}
$$

## Sourcing code and working with variable

```{r}
#| include: false
#| eval: true
#source(here::here("analysis/scripts/statistics_for_paper.R"))
```

The 'analysis/scripts/statistics_for_paper.R' script is sourced and it runs but the output is not included in the knitted output. But we can access the variables defined in the sourced script simply by adding \` r var_name \` between \` backticks, in this case max_PRC value is (now this number comes from our sourced script).

If we update the data, the script can recalculate the variable we want to refer to in the text and update the number.
