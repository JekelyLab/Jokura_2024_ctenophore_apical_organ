The lobate ctenophore *Mnemiopsis*

The lithocytes have a large calcium carbonate concretion and... [@Tamm_2014] Living lithocytes are transported along the balancer cilia to the tip of the statocyst [@Noda_2014] The projections of a group of bridge cells located on two sides of the apical organ forms an arch and connects the balancers along the tentacular plane [@Tamm_2002].

## Results

### Volume EM reconstruction of the *Mnemiopsis* apical organ

First, we embedded the entire body of the *Mnemiopsis leidyi* cydippid-stage larvae, five days post-fertilization, in Epon resin following high-pressure freezing. To reconstruct all synaptic-resolution connections among the cells comprising the apical organ, also known as the aboral organ, we prepared approximately 1,000 ultra-thin serial sections (50 nm thick) from the aboral tip of the larval body embedded in the resin block. Using a scanning electron microscope (Gemini SEM 500) with a resolution of 2.0 nm/pixel, we imaged only the region containing the apical organ. Subsequently, 620 of these images were stitched and aligned using TrakEM2. The resulting volumetric EM dataset had dimensions of 60 μm × 40 μm × 30 μm. We traced and annotated all cells in this dataset, ultimately reconstructing 909 cells, each with both nuclei and cell bodies intact.

Cells containing cilia were traced down to the tips of the cilia, and basal bodies were annotated accordingly. For neuronal skeletonization, nodes were placed to interconnect the profiles of the same neuron’s processes across layers, extending the skeleton until all branches were fully traced. Each node was tagged, and skeletons were named and assigned multi-level annotations. As described later, many neurons we identified formed loop-like structures (anastomosed neurons), wherein separated branches often rejoined either the main trunk or other branches. In such cases, branch nodes were placed near the closest existing node and annotated accordingly. The entire skeletonized volume was composed of 134,591 nodes. However, 88 fragments could not be attached to somata-associated skeletons. Most of these fragments represented short skeletal branches that could not be traced beyond gaps or low-quality layers.

Next, we decided to divide the entire apical organ into four broad quadrants to facilitate grouping the identified cells. The general body plan of ctenophores, when viewed from the aboral side, exhibits biradial symmetry around the positions of the anal pores. This symmetry corresponds to the four blastomeres present at the four-cell stage during early embryonic development. We categorized the traced cells into four quadrants and designated these groups as Q1 through Q4 for clarity and consistency.

### Identification of Synaptic Structures in Syncytium Neurons

Classical neural staining techniques do not provide clear images of the neurons at the aboral pole. However, ultrastructural studies have provided morphological evidence of elements resembling neurons, based on synaptic structures, located on the epithelial floor of the apical organs [@Horridge_1964; @Hernandez_Nicaise_1973]. Based on these findings, we identified synaptic structures characteristic of ctenophore neurons in our data, using previously identified pre-synaptic triad morphological features, such as single-layered vesicles, smooth endoplasmic reticulum, and tightly packed mitochondria. In our study, we specifically identified synaptic sites and marked mitochondria (orange) as synaptic nodes. The regions where synaptic vesicles align were marked as connectors (light blue arrows) between cells across the membrane. These connectors link the synaptic nodes of the pre-synaptic cytoskeleton to the partner nodes of the post-synaptic cytoskeleton. As previously reported, the specialization of post-synaptic structures in ctenophores is not apparent, so we recognized synaptic vesicle clusters on the pre-synaptic membrane as the point of reference. Synapses were identified as either monoadic or polyadic, with one pre-synaptic neuron forming connections with one or multiple post-synaptic cells.

As mentioned above, following the identification of the presynaptic structures, we reconstructed three major Syncytial neurons. Each of these Syncytial neurons was a cell with multiple nuclei, with membranes fused by continuous plasma membranes. These neurons are distinct in morphology from the Syncytial subepithelial nerve net (SNN) neurons with blebbed morphology previously reconstructed in 3D [@Burkhardt_2023]. Our findings represent the second documented discovery of Syncytial neurons in ctenophores. Furthermore, these neurons exhibited clear morphological differences when compared to other sensory cells reported in the same study, such as mesogleal neurons and sensory cells with presynaptic structures and cilia (types 1-4)[@Burkhardt_2023]. Based on their distinct spatial relationships, we were able to classify these three Syncytial neurons into two categories. The first type is a larger "AO neuron_Q1234," which possesses four (or possibly six?) nuclei spanning four quadrants. It contained X presynaptic structures. The second type consists of "AO neuron_Q12" and "AO neuron_Q34," each having two nuclei spanning two quadrants, and each containing X presynaptic structures.

### Identification the Gravity-Sensitive Neural Circuit via the Syncytial Neurons Network

We discovered that AO neurons form synaptic connections with each other, and that AO neuron_Q1234 forms self-synapses, or “autapses.” To our knowledge, previous reports have not identified synaptic connections between subepithelial nerve net (SNN) neurons. Thus, our results represent the first report of synaptic connectivity between neurons in the apical organ, forming a network in ctenophores (subject to confirmation). These AO neuron networks were found to form many presynaptic structures in relation to the gravity-sensing balancer cells.

Balancer cells are monociliated cells, and their cilia protrude longer than those of other monociliated cells. Moreover, the cilia of balancer cells are bundled into four groups at the center of the apical organ, forming a compound cilium. Based on these features, we identified and classified the balancer cells. The cellular arrangement differed clearly when viewed in the lateral view, sagittal plane, and tentacular plane, with the cell bodies gathering toward the apical organ in the tentacular plane. In each quadrant, the number of cells was as follows: Q1: 37, Q2: 32, Q3: 32, Q4: 28. Each cell contained 3 to 10 ? mitochondria.

From AO neuron_Q1Q2, synapses were formed with 6 of the 37 balancer cells in the Q1 region, and 8 of the 32 balancer cells in the Q2 region. Similarly, from AO neuron_Q3Q4, synapses were formed with 1 of the 32 balancer cells in the Q3 region, and 5 of the 28 balancer cells in the Q4 region. AO neuron_Q1234 formed input synapses with balancer cells in the Q1 region (7 cells), Q2 region (11 cells), Q3 region (6 cells), and Q4 region (10 cells). Some balancer cells received inputs from both AO neuron_Q1Q2 or AO neuron_Q3Q4 and AO neuron_Q1234. While previous studies have suggested the presence of afferent synapses from balancer cells to neurons [@Hernandez_Nicaise_1974], our data did not reveal any synaptic inputs from balancer cells to AO neurons. However, we identified "bridge cells" that actively formed input synapses with AO neurons, highlighting their potential role in the network.

### Identification of Neuron-like Bridge Cells Forming Afferent Synapses in the Gravity-Sensitive Neural Circuit

From our data, we identified several cell groups that form multiple afferent synapses with AO neurons. These cells, based on their morphological features, were found to be the bridge cells first described by Tamm et al. in 2002 [@Tamm_and_Tamm_2002]. These cells are characterized by bundles of elongated processes filled with microtubules that arch over the epithelial layer, resembling a bridge. They originate from the base of paired balancer cells along the tentacle surface and extend across the sagittal plane toward the base of the opposite balancer cells. In regions where the mitochondria of the bridge cells are localized (approximately 30%), a presynaptic triad structure, similar to that of AO neurons, was found, containing synaptic vesicles and smooth endoplasmic reticulum.

Our three-dimensional reconstruction data revealed that the bridge cells form two distinct cell groups across the sagittal plane, between the Q1Q2 and Q3Q4 regions. In the Q1Q2 region, 14 cells were identified, while in the Q3Q4 region, 12 cells were identified, totaling 26 bridge cells. Nearly all of these bridge cells (25 out of 26) exhibited afferent synapses from AO neurons. For bridge cells located in the Q1Q2 region, synaptic inputs came primarily from AO neuron_Q1Q2 (11 cells), AO neuron_Q1234 (1 cell), or both (2 cells). For bridge cells located in the Q3Q4 region, synaptic inputs were received from AO neuron_Q3Q4 (1 cell), AO neuron_Q1234 (7 cells), or both (1 cell). In other words, bridge cells in the Q1Q2 region mainly received input from AO neuron_Q1Q2, while those in the Q3Q4 region received input primarily from AO neuron_Q1234, showing a distinct pattern of input in the two regions.

Some bridge cells also formed afferent synapses with AO neurons. For example, bridge cells in the Q1Q2 region formed synapses with AO neuron_Q1Q2 (3 cells) or both AO neuron_Q1Q2 and AO neuron_Q1234 (2 cells). Bridge cells in the Q3Q4 region formed synapses with AO neuron_Q3Q4 (1 cell) or AO neuron_Q1234 (6 cells). A notable difference was observed between the Q1Q2 and Q3Q4 regions in the proportion of synaptic inputs from bridge cells to AO neurons.

Interestingly, in both regions, bridge cells also formed synapses with adjacent bridge cells. However, no synaptic input was found from bridge cells across the sagittal plane to those in the opposite region. To analyze the grouped synaptic connectivity graph, we classified cell types within each region, collapsed cells of the same type into a single node, summed the number of synapses, and explored directed pathways to effectors (balancer cell groups). The results revealed a feedback pathway from AO neurons through the synaptic connections formed by bridge cells, thereby shedding light on the neural circuit structure involving these cells.

### Control of Balancer Ciliary Movements by Gravity-Sensitive Neural Circuits

To investigate the function of gravity-sensitive circuits, we conducted a comparative analysis of balancer ciliary movements across different regions. Previous studies (Tamm, 1980, 1982; Lowe, 1997) have established that balancer cilia function as mechanoreceptors, with their beating frequency modulated by inclination. Furthermore, it has been suggested that differences in the asymmetry of statolith morphology and the elongation direction of balancer cilia between the tentacular and sagittal planes could result in variations in the force received from the statolith (Tamm, 2014, 2015). Building on these findings, we standardized conditions for observing balancer cilia by tilting the microscope by 90 degrees and fixing samples such that the aboral-oral axis was aligned parallel to the vertical stage, with the aboral side facing upward. Using connectome analysis, we aimed to evaluate the neural circuit differences by analyzing the control patterns of left and right balancer cilia in the tentacular and sagittal planes. Specifically, we hypothesized that differences in control between Q1 (Q2) and Q3 (Q4) regions, as well as between Q1 (Q4) and Q2 (Q3) regions, would reveal distinct functions of AO neurons (e.g., AO neuron Q12/Q34 vs. AO neuron Q1234). For the sagittal plane, we recorded balancer ciliary movements in the Q1(4) and Q2(3) regions (left and right sides of the image) and, for the tentacular plane, in the Q1(3) and Q2(4) regions, using a high-speed camera (100 fps) for 2 minutes (12,000 frames). Regions of interest (ROIs) were defined in areas where brightness changes indicated ciliary beating. We measured these brightness changes to generate dynamics graphs of balancer ciliary movements for both planes.

During the 2-minute recordings, balancer cilia exhibited movements that could be fast, slow, or stop abruptly (arrest) and start moving again (re-beat). Occasionally, large contraction responses caused the entire cydippid to move out of frame, and data from these moments were excluded. We focused on two metrics for left-right comparison: (1) the timing of ciliary arrest and (2) the timing of re-beat initiation following an arrest. Due to the low baseline beating frequency of the cilia, rapid synaptic input responses were not evaluated, suggesting that ciliary beat regulation may involve non-synaptic control mechanisms. The analysis revealed that both arrest and re-beat events were synchronized between left and right balancers in both planes within a few milliseconds, suggesting that these events are governed by synaptic input from neurons. Interestingly, while the re-beat timing showed no significant differences between the sagittal and tentacular planes, arrest timing exhibited greater variability in the tentacular plane. Comparing these findings with neural circuit diagrams suggests that in the sagittal plane, the same AO neurons (Q12 or Q34) project to both balancer cell groups, transmitting signals simultaneously and enabling synchronization. In contrast, in the tentacular plane, separate AO neurons project to different regions, potentially introducing an additional synaptic step, which may account for the observed variability in arrest timing.

## Discussion

## Materials and Methods

### Data and Code Availability

The following EM image stacks, including all traces and annotations, are available at https://catmaid.jekelylab.ex.ac.uk. These datasets can be queried either within CATMAID or through the CATMAID application programming interface (API) using the catmaid or natverse packages (Bates et al., 2020). The dataset encompasses all EM images (in JPG format), skeletons, meshes, node tags, connectors, and annotations. 
Additionally, we provide all R scripts used for data acquisition and figure generation (Jokura et al., 2025). All plots, figures (including anatomical renderings), and figure layouts can be fully reproduced using the provided R scripts. While the scripts are mostly organized by figure, some general-purpose scripts—for tasks such as loading libraries, accessing CATMAID data, and defining common functions—are shared across multiple figures.

### Specimen Preparation, Transmission Electron Microscopy, and Image Processing

Larvae of Mnemiopsis leidyi (5 days old) were cryofixed using a high-pressure freezing apparatus (BAL-TEC HPM 010, Balzers) and immediately transferred to liquid nitrogen for storage. The frozen samples were processed in a substitution medium containing 2% (w/v) osmium tetroxide and 0.5% uranyl acetate in acetone, using a cryo-substitution device (EM AFS-2, Leica). Cryo-substitution was performed by gradually raising the temperature, and the samples were embedded in epoxy resin. Serial sections of 50 nm thickness were prepared using a Reichert Jung Ultracut E ultramicrotome and a 45º DiATOME diamond knife.
To enhance section adhesion and improve hydrophilicity, a conductive indium tin oxide-coated glass slide (ITO Glass, UQG Optics) was treated with air glow discharge using the PELCO easiGlow system (Ted Pella, Inc.), rendering the carbon film surface negatively charged. Section ribbons were collected on the prepared glass slides, slowly dried to ensure proper stretching, and firmly adhered to the glass surface. The sections on glass were stained with UranyLess and lead citrate (Reynolds) using airless staining bottles (Delta Microscopies). The glass slides were mounted on STEM-specific stages (Zeiss) using Copper Foil EMI Shielding Tape (3M).
Imaging was performed using a Gemini SEM 500 (Zeiss) equipped with SmartSEM and Atlas 5 imaging software (Zeiss). The full dataset consisted of 620 serial sections, each 50 nm thick. The imaging resolution was 2.8 nm/pixel, using electron holography transmission at an acceleration voltage of 1.5 kV (in-lens detector, dwell time: 3 µs).

### Image-Stack Realignment and Spatial Data Transformation in CATMAID

To process the image stack, we utilized the TrakEM2 plugin of FIJI (ImageJ) (version 2.0.0-rc-15/1.49k / Java 1.6.0_24 (64-bit) – 2014). A project was created, and all TIFF images were imported using the "import sequence as grid" function. Subsequently, the following filters were applied sequentially: Invert, Equalize Histogram, and Gaussian Blur.

The alignment process consisted of three stages, each progressively refining the spatial accuracy:

Rigid Alignment
Initially, a rigid alignment was performed with the following parameters: least squares mode (linear feature correspondences), encompassing the entire layer range with the first layer as the reference. Only visible images were used, without propagation. The alignment was executed with an initial Gaussian blur of 1.6 pixels, three steps per scale octave, a minimum image size of 512 pixels, and a maximum of 2048 pixels. Additional parameters included a feature descriptor size of 8, orientation bins of 8, and a closest ratio of 0.92. The alignment allowed clearing the cache, using 32 feature extraction threads, a maximal alignment error of 100 pixels, a minimal inlier ratio of 0.20, and a minimum of 12 inliers. The expected and desired transformations were set to rigid, with testing multiple hypotheses (tolerance: 5.00 pixels) and considering up to 5 neighboring layers, giving up after 5 failures. Regularization was performed with a maximal iteration of 1000, a maximal plateau width of 200, and a rigid lambda of 0.10.

Affine Alignment
Following the rigid alignment, an affine alignment was applied using similar parameters, except the expected and desired transformations were set to affine. The minimal image size was reduced to 64 pixels, while the other parameters (e.g., Gaussian blur, feature descriptor size, inliers, and testing hypotheses) remained unchanged to ensure consistent processing.

Elastic Alignment
Two iterations of elastic alignment were performed to fine-tune the spatial data. Key parameters included a block matching layer scale of 0.05, a search radius of 200 pixels, a block radius of 2000 pixels, and a resolution of 60. Correlation filters were employed with a minimal PMCC r of 0.10, a maximal curvature ratio of 1000, and a maximal second-best r/best r of 0.90. A local smoothness filter was applied with the approximate local transformation set to affine, a local region sigma of 1000 pixels, and an absolute maximal local displacement of 10 pixels (relative maximal displacement: 3.00). Pre-aligned layers were tested for up to 4 neighboring layers. The elastic alignment used a rigid approximation, maximal iterations of 3000, a plateau width of 200, spring mesh stiffness of 0.01, and a maximal stretch of 2000 pixels. A legacy optimizer was employed to enhance performance.

After each alignment stage, the project was saved as an XML file under a unique name to preserve iterative progress. Finally, the images were exported from FIJI using TrakEM2 in a format compatible with CATMAID.

### Neuron Tracing, Synapse Annotation, and Review

The reconstruction of cells and connectivity was performed using CATMAID (Saalfeld et al., 2009), analyzing a total of 620 serial sections. To digitally reconstruct all neurons within the serial TEM dataset, we utilized the collaborative web-based application CATMAID, installed on a local server (Saalfeld et al., 2009; Schneider-Mizell et al., 2016). To mark the locations of cell bodies, we placed tags at the approximate center of each nucleus within the dataset. At each nuclear center, the radius of the single node was adjusted according to the size of the cell body in that specific layer. All skeletons were rooted at their respective cell bodies, and nodes were tagged as "soma."
Synapses were identified based on four key structural features: the cell membrane, synaptic vesicles, the endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria. Most synapses could be verified across consecutive sections, ensuring accurate annotation and connectivity mapping.

### Cell Nomenclature and Annotations

Each cell is assigned a specific type name based on its category (balancer, biC, bridge, bristle, dense vesicle cell, dome, EF, IcMC, LB, lithocyte, monoC, non-C, plumose cell, SNN, ssCG, SSN, stCG), resulting in a total of 17 cell types. Additionally, a quadrant number is appended to the cell type name following an underscore ("_") to indicate the cell body’s location. For example, cells located in the first quadrant are annotated with "Q1." If a cell is situated between the first and second quadrants, the annotation "Q1Q2" is applied.

Cells of the same type within the same region are further distinguished by serial numbering. Each cell is also assigned multiple annotations, which can be utilized to query the database via CATMAID or the CATMAID API (e.g., using the R catmaid package). These annotations provide a structured and precise framework for identifying and analyzing specific cells, facilitating robust data integration and retrieval within the dataset.

This system ensures consistent and accurate tracking of cellular data, enabling comprehensive analysis of cellular structures and functions across regions.

### Analysis of Balancer Cilia

We conducted the analysis using the cydippid stage of Mnemiopsis leidyi at five days post-fertilization. A coverslip with a thin layer of Vaseline applied to two edges was lightly placed on a slide glass. Filtered natural seawater was introduced under the coverslip, along with the cydippids. By gently moving the coverslip, the desired orientation for observation was adjusted, and once positioned, slight pressure was applied to immobilize the cydippids. To stabilize the statolith's position, the microscope was tilted 90 degrees, arranging the stage vertically.
The movement of the balancer cilia was observed using a differential interference contrast (DIC) microscope (Zeiss Axio Imager.M2) equipped with a highly sensitive CMOS monochrome camera optimized for the near-infrared (NIR) range (UI-3360CP-NIR-GL Rev.2, iDS). Observations were made using a 40x objective lens (Objective LD LCI Plan-Apochromat 40x/1.2 Imm Corr DIC M27) with glycerine immersion. For recording, we employed a custom-made NIR LED strobe illumination system (wavelength: 850 nm) synchronized with the camera's exposure signals.
The camera and LED strobe system were operated using the Video Capture Software BohNavi. Images were recorded at a resolution of 640×480 pixels with a frame rate of 100 fps for 2 minutes, using 0.05 ms pulses from the LED. To analyze the ciliary beating of the balancer cilia, we utilized the Multi Kymograph project in Fiji software.
