## Abstract

**text in bold** *italic* [underline]{.underline}

## Introduction

First descriptions of AO: [@aronova1974electron]

The lobate ctenophore *Mnemiopsis*

The lithocytes have a large calcium carbonate concretion and... [@Tamm_2014] Living lithocytes are transported along the balancer cilia to the tip of the statocyst [@Noda_2014] The projections of a group of bridge cells located on two sides of the apical organ forms an arch and connects the balancers along the tentacular plane [@Tamm_2002].

The easiest way is to use the command line to add new refs to the .bib file:

```{bash}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

#curl -LH "Accept: application/x-bibtex" https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.91258.1 >> references.bib
```

## Results

### Volume EM reconstruction of the *Mnemiopsis* apical organ

First, we embedded the entire body of the *Mnemiopsis leidyi* cydippid-stage larvae, five days post-fertilization, in Epon resin following high-pressure freezing. To reconstruct all synaptic-resolution connections among the cells comprising the apical organ, also known as the aboral organ, we prepared approximately 1,000 ultra-thin serial sections (50 nm thick) from the aboral tip of the larval body embedded in the resin block. Using a scanning electron microscope (Gemini SEM 500) with a resolution of 2.0 nm/pixel, we imaged only the region containing the apical organ. Subsequently, 620 of these images were stitched and aligned using TrakEM2. The resulting volumetric EM dataset had dimensions of 60 μm × 40 μm × 30 μm. We traced and annotated all cells in this dataset, ultimately reconstructing 909 cells, each with both nuclei and cell bodies intact.

Cells containing cilia were traced down to the tips of the cilia, and basal bodies were annotated accordingly. For neuronal skeletonization, nodes were placed to interconnect the profiles of the same neuron’s processes across layers, extending the skeleton until all branches were fully traced. Each node was tagged, and skeletons were named and assigned multi-level annotations. As described later, many neurons we identified formed loop-like structures (anastomosed neurons), wherein separated branches often rejoined either the main trunk or other branches. In such cases, branch nodes were placed near the closest existing node and annotated accordingly. The entire skeletonized volume was composed of 134,591 nodes. However, 88 fragments could not be attached to somata-associated skeletons. Most of these fragments represented short skeletal branches that could not be traced beyond gaps or low-quality layers.

Next, we decided to divide the entire apical organ into four broad quadrants to facilitate grouping the identified cells. The general body plan of ctenophores, when viewed from the aboral side, exhibits biradial symmetry around the positions of the anal pores. This symmetry corresponds to the four blastomeres present at the four-cell stage during early embryonic development. We categorized the traced cells into four quadrants and designated these groups as Q1 through Q4 for clarity and consistency.

### Identification of Synaptic Structures in Syncytium Neurons

Classical neural staining techniques do not provide clear images of the neurons at the aboral pole. However, ultrastructural studies have provided morphological evidence of elements resembling neurons, based on synaptic structures, located on the epithelial floor of the apical organs [@Horridge_1964; @Hernandez_Nicaise_1973]. Based on these findings, we identified synaptic structures characteristic of ctenophore neurons in our data, using previously identified pre-synaptic triad morphological features, such as single-layered vesicles, smooth endoplasmic reticulum, and tightly packed mitochondria. In our study, we specifically identified synaptic sites and marked mitochondria (orange) as synaptic nodes. The regions where synaptic vesicles align were marked as connectors (light blue arrows) between cells across the membrane. These connectors link the synaptic nodes of the pre-synaptic cytoskeleton to the partner nodes of the post-synaptic cytoskeleton. As previously reported, the specialization of post-synaptic structures in ctenophores is not apparent, so we recognized synaptic vesicle clusters on the pre-synaptic membrane as the point of reference. Synapses were identified as either monoadic or polyadic, with one pre-synaptic neuron forming connections with one or multiple post-synaptic cells.

As mentioned above, following the identification of the presynaptic structures, we reconstructed three major Syncytial neurons. Each of these Syncytial neurons was a cell with multiple nuclei, with membranes fused by continuous plasma membranes. These neurons are distinct in morphology from the Syncytial subepithelial nerve net (SNN) neurons with blebbed morphology previously reconstructed in 3D [@Burkhardt_2023]. Our findings represent the second documented discovery of Syncytial neurons in ctenophores. Furthermore, these neurons exhibited clear morphological differences when compared to other sensory cells reported in the same study, such as mesogleal neurons and sensory cells with presynaptic structures and cilia (types 1-4)[@Burkhardt_2023]. Based on their distinct spatial relationships, we were able to classify these three Syncytial neurons into two categories. The first type is a larger "AO neuron_Q1234," which possesses four (or possibly six?) nuclei spanning four quadrants. It contained X presynaptic structures. The second type consists of "AO neuron_Q12" and "AO neuron_Q34," each having two nuclei spanning two quadrants, and each containing X presynaptic structures.

## Sourcing code and working with variable

```{r}
#| include: false
#| eval: true
#source(here::here("analysis/scripts/statistics_for_paper.R"))
```

The 'analysis/scripts/statistics_for_paper.R' script is sourced and it runs but the output is not included in the knitted output. But we can access the variables defined in the sourced script simply by adding \` r var_name \` between \` backticks, in this case max_PRC value is (now this number comes from our sourced script).

If we update the data, the script can recalculate the variable we want to refer to in the text and update the number.
